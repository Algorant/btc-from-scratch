# Bitcoin From Scratch 

#### This is me going through Andrej Karpathy's "A from-scratch tour of Bitcoin in Python" found [here](https://karpathy.github.io/2021/06/21/blockchain/)

#### Its a Jupyter notebook. The diffing folder is just where I diffed my snippets with his code to find typos. I slightly edited various things (variable names, salt, etc) to make sure I understood certain things myself.

#### I will be adding this to the open source project [Bitcoin Data Science](http://www.bitcoindatascience.com/) once complete.
